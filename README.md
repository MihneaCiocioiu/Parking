# Parking
Caphyon internship project

This parking simulation is pretty easy to understand.
All of the different types of parking lots are being displayed on the screen, coloured accordingly!
Every second, there is a 50% chance that a car will pull up to one of the parking lots.
The orange parking lots support parking for up to one hour.
The purple parking lots support parking for up to 3 hours.
The blue parking lots support parking for up to 24 hours.

The prices differ according to the location of the parking lot (center, busy areas, residential areas)
The parking lots can also have different prices according to hour intervals

For example, parking may be 10 dollars normally, but it can get to 20 dollars between 6 AM and 12 AM

Also, if a car has only 10 minutes of parking available, the driver is notified and a '!' appears near the car to show the notification.

The starting parking lots can be modified by changing the "ParkingLots.txt" file.
If the file is eddited, it should follow the same format as the original file.
