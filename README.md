# Parking
Caphyon internship project

This parking simulation is pretty easy to understand.
All of the different types of parking lots are being displayed on the screen, coloured accordingly!
Every second, there is a 50% chance that a car will pull up to one of the parking lots.
The orange parking lots support parking for up to one hour.
The purple parking lots support parking for up to 3 hours.
The blue parking lots support parking for up to 24 hours.
